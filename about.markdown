Hey there! 
<br>
My name is Praise Winston, I'm a software engineer by profession and a competitive programmer, musician and a thinker by choice/chance.
<br>
<br>
I created this blog to share the weird ideas, shower thoughts that randomly spring up in my brain at times along with the other stuffs. I don't know when my time would be over so better share with the world what I learnt before it's too late. :P
<br>
<br>
I mostly spend time chewing and munching on some algorithmic puzzle or working on my fun little side projects.
<br>
My favorite activity is thinking.
