Hey there! 
My name is Praise Winston, I'm a software engineer by profession and a competitive programmer, musician, thinker(and a lot more...) by choice.
I created this blog to share the weird ideas, shower thoughts that randomly spring up in my brain at times along with the other stuffs. I don't know when my time would be over so better share with the world what I learnt before it's too late. :P
I mostly spend time chewing and munching on some algorithmic puzzle or working on my fun little side projects.
My favorite activity is thinking.
