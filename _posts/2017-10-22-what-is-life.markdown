<!-- <h1><u> What is Life? </u></h1> -->

It all started with a Big Bang, that’s the opening title of the famous comedy-nerdy show “The Big Bang Theory”. But that’s how the universe was born with a — Big Bang (atleast according to scientists). And the universe is expanding, but what about us? We come to this earth from our mother’s womb, filled with curiosity around pondering on what’s going around us. At around age 4 or 5 we are sent to schools, then college, then we become the slaves of the modern-wage system doing a typical 9 to 5 jobs.

Slowly and slowly, this natural curiosity which was in us, initially, dies within us because we begin to accept things around us as it is. And the charms of money and fame try to embrace our lives. Rarely, do we stop and think- What am I doing? Where do I come from? What is the meaning of life?

All these questions bothered me from my teenage life. Some say that happiness is life’s purpose, some others say relationships are life’s real purpose, some say that doing God’s will is life’s purpose.

But to me, I guess the life’s real purpose is to be curious and continue searching the truth in everything. Just continue to be curious, look at the stars and wonder about their origin, look at the trees, look at the small creeping creatures and enjoy them moving, while continuing to think about their behavior and so on.

To me that’s the meaning of life and that’s what gave birth to the scientific era and finally the technological revolution which we are experiencing now! And who knows, maybe this curious attitude will lead you to become the next Nobel Laureate!!
