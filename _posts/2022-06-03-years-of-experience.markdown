<h1> Years of "Experience" </h1>

It never makes much sense to me when I see hiring posts requiring X years of experience on something, some framework, some tech. One could have years of experience and still be incompetent to provide good, efficient solutions. 
People are different, some people can understand a given system very fast and so their just 1 year of "experience" would probably be equal to someone else's 5 years of experience. And also the quality of the experience matters, let's say someone said they have 5 years of experience doing C++ but all they did was maintain the company's codebase, fixing trivial bugs and such while the other guy with the same amount of experience built multiple low-level scalable applications and systems. 
The richness of the experience of the latter exceeds than that of the former. Quality over quantity.
